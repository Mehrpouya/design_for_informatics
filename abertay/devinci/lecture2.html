        ##Steps
        - Research research research
        - Create a game design
        - Develop & Iterate and prototype
        - “If a rule is difficult to explain in words or easily forgotten, consider cutting it.” - Sen-Foong Lim
        - Get rid of sub games that are not needed
        - attend [boardgame meetups](https://www.meetup.com/topics/board-games/fr/paris/)
        - Blind Test the game, Get people who don't know about your game to play it.

        ### [Questions](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/how-to-learn-board-game-design-and-development--gamedev-11607) to ask yourself - Part 1
        - How many players will there be?
        - How long should the game be?
        - What choices will the player make, and when will they make them?
        - How will the player make these choices?
        - How will one player's choice impact the other players?
        - How will the players interact with each other?

      ### [Questions](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/how-to-learn-board-game-design-and-development--gamedev-11607) to ask yourself - part 2

      - Are there any choices that can be made by one player, but not by the others?
      - How does the game progress? Is it strictly turn-based, or is it in rounds with phases?
      - What actions will the player be able to take?
      - How will the outcome of an action be determined?
      - What is the player's goal?
      - How can the player win?

  <section  data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
    ### More questions to ask
    - What emotions are you hoping to generate amongst the players?
    - How long are you hoping your game to take?
    - What discussions are you hoping to encourage? How the mechanics and narrative can help with this?
    - How your choice of material can create certain atmospheres?
    - What are the intended and unintended consequences of your design?
    - What is your message?

<section  data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
  From [Games journal](http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/WhatIsaGame.shtml)
  - What should the board look like?
  - How many spaces should it have?
  - What shape do the spaces have: square, hexagonal, or round?
  - How are the spaces laid out?
  - Are all the spaces the same size or are they of different sizes?
  - How many pieces are there?
  - What do the pieces look like? Does a piece take more than one space when played?

          - Focus group
          - Field observations
          - Interview
          - Survey
          - tasks you designed and how you engaged with them

          ##Pitch presentations
          On Friday in your practical you will pitch your game concepts. We will have some members of your Uni and guests to look at your games. Remember this is not just about pitching, It is also about learning how to think like a designer. Try to help others by analysing and questioning their design.

          "Someone who plays video games for 10 hours a day, for example, would be considered an idle person, and someone who frequently buys diapers would be considered as probably a parent, who on balance is more likely to have a sense of responsibility," Li Yingyun, Sesame's technology director told Caixin, a Chinese magazine, in February.

          A lengthy planning document from China's elite State Council explains that social credit will "forge a public opinion environment that trust-keeping is glorious", warning that the "new system will reward those who report acts of breach of trust".

          One of the great characteristics of video games is the ability to immerse and live an experience based on your decisions. The stronger the narrative design of the game, the stronger effects it may have on players.

          Currently there are two industries running side by side. Game industry as we know it, with primary purpose of entertainment, and Education, which aims to purely educate audiences. However real learning often happens somewhere in between the two. Like anything else in life, learning and entertainment is also a spectrum. Try to think where your concept and game sits within this spectrum.

          In Bioshock you have to decide throughout the game, what weapons or perks are more useful for the challenges of that part of game. On the other hand If you have unlimited inventory, this may also confuse the player about what to choose for each challenge.

          ##Think like a designer
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          So far you have learned various ways to critique and anlyse games, in this section we will discuss a few more techniques and things to look out for to help you to critique and analyse each others work.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          ###Think like a designer n.1
            - Think about default scenarios that they designed?
            - What are the important mechanics?
            - What technical glitches the game has and how designers tried to resolve them! In a boardgame these can be seen as gaps in mechanics, narrative or the relationship between the two. cross player interaction,...
            - What were their point of views?
            - What is the relationship between rules and the play they create?
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          ###Think like a designer n.2
          - Try to think why the designer had to put each of those rules in their game?
          - How does each piece integrates into the whole story and game narrative?
          - How would the game change if you remove any of the rules?
          - Change some of the rules, play again and find out how they affect the game experience?
          - Identify, define and analyse metrics. These are the type of information that you collect from the user, how the designer is using them and how they are being presented in the game.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          ##Playtest
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          ###When you play-test your game or another game:
          - try to see if the game is playable without any help from the designer.
          - They should be self-explanatory.
          - Remember you won’t be there to help people playing your board game!
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          ###When you’re play testing:
          - Try to only offer the player the rule book of your game
          - Write down questions they ask and how they are playing your game?
          - Whether what they are playing is anything like what you have designed?
          - Try to give them as little information as possible as you are biased.
          - Think about why they are asking certain questions
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          There is always something to learn from testing your game, you need to find the right questions to ask!
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          The sooner you start play testing, the easier it will be to make changes. Bear in mind not to make too many dramatical changes which can result in you loosing your path and direction.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          ###You can’t just test your game yourself try step 1:
          - **friends and family:** this is still biased as they may try to avoid giving you any critical feedback ro question your dicisions, specially if you may get upset or annoyed by their feedback.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          ###You can’t just test your game yourself try step 2:
          - **Hardcore Gamers:** this again will give you a specific type of feedback. They are already familiar with many different game mechanics and has a a lot of experience of playing various video games. Their preferred genre of games may also affect their feedback as they are more specialised users.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          ###You can’t just test your game yourself try step 3:
          - **casual players** they are the ones that may help you to improve some obvious flaws in your game design. Some of you experienced this when you were reading the game manuals of the board games you’ve played.
