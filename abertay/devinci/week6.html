          ##Towards a definition of games
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#000">
          > To play a game is to engage in activity directed toward bringing about a specific state of affairs, using only means permitted by specific rules, where the means permitted by the rules are more limited in scope than they would be in the absence of the rules, and where the sole reason for accepting such limitation is to make possible such activity.

          Bernard Suits
          Philosophy of Science
          Vol. 34, No. 2 (Jun., 1967)
        </section>

          >In the German language a game is any activity which is executed only for pleasure and without conscious purpose.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#000">
          > Games are objects which consist of components and rules and have certain criteria: rules, a goal, always changing course; chance; competition; common experience; equality; freedom; activity; diving into the world of the game; and no impact on reality.

        ### [Questions](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/how-to-learn-board-game-design-and-development--gamedev-11607) to ask yourself - part 2

        - Are there any choices that can be made by one player, but not by the others?
        - How does the game progress? Is it strictly turn-based, or is it in rounds with phases?

        - How will the outcome of an action be determined?
        - What is the player's goal?

      ### More questions to ask
      - What emotions are you hoping to generate amongst the players?
      - How long are you hoping your game to take?
      - What discussions are you hoping to encourage? How the mechanics and narrative can help with this?

      - What are the intended and unintended consequences of your design?
      - What is your message?

    - How are the spaces laid out?
    - Are all the spaces the same size or are they of different sizes?
    - How many pieces are there?
    - What do the pieces look like? Does a piece take more than one space when played?
