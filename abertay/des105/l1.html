          ##What will we learn together?
          - Overview of some of the existing game engines
          - Game engine terminology and concepts
          - Programming terminology and concepts
          - Be able to apply this knowledge to practical applications (utilising game engines)
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## How will we learn?
          **Each week**
          - **1 Lectorial**: lecture & tutorial per week
          - **1 Practical**: 2 hours supervised activities.
          - **Practice and personal study**: I recommend at least 7 hours weekly.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## Usual structure of a Lectorial session
          - Introducing you to new concepts and theories
          - Making sure you understand your practical activity for the lab session
          - Catch up, raise and discuss any ongoing issues/concerns
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## Usual structure of a Practical session
          - 3 presentations by you, each about 5 minutes.
          - we spend rest of our time on practicing & learning in the lab.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## Your 5 minutes presentation
          - You only have to do it once, but you have to! unless you have a good reason not to.
            - If you can't present, You will make the presentation and I will do it on your behalf.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          - Investigate a game of your choice
          - Spend sometime on blogs and other internet sources to find out more about:
            - What game engine was being used?
            - Physics engine
            - Specific characteristics of that engine/game
          - Your own analysis and observation
            - What did you think?
          Your opinion is as important as the sources!
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          - Lectorial and practical material will be on Blackboard prior or just after the lecture each week.
          - Let's have a quick overview and look at [blackboard](https://blackboard.abertay.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_455011_1&course_id=_7456_1).
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ##Advise
          - Try to go through what we discussed in each lectorial on the same day.
          - Aim to also watch the external recommended videos. (This will be at the end of each lectorial presentation)

          ## If I miss or can't come to my own lab, can I join another one?
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## Short answer no
          There are currently 82 of you. The lab has limited number of PCs and if we don't stick with what the registry has designed and organised for us, we'll end up with chaos.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## Long answer yes
          I'm happy to accommodate your needs and try to make this work for you. I appreciate you may have a **valid** reason to change your lab session, in this case you need to find someone from another DES105 lab to switch their place with you.

          If you slept in, or missed the bus or trying to finish a game level before coming to the class, then you can come to the next lab, but we can't guarantee to be able to fit you in again due to class numbers.

          ### Summary of your lab activity:
          - Follow the practical document. This can be accessed via blackboard
          - Spend sometime with the interface:
            - Understand modular Unity interface and customise it.
            - Remove some views and windows and try to add them back to the interface again.
          - Learn and find out about some navigation shortcuts.
          - Add, edit, group and remove some game objects and components to familiarise yourselves with them. Don't worry if you don't understand many of these yet.
