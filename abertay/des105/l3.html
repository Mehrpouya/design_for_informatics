          If you didn't manage to learn about github and version control remember to study the version control document from last week. Your priority is the practical material for today.

          This will be Basics of C# programming, Practical II, III, IV - **Part 2**
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## Why practical name says II,III,IV?
          - The practical material for the next, previous and this week are related. You are welcome to go through them at your own pace as long as you make sure you finish them by end of week 4.

          ### Summary of your lab activity:
          - Follow the practical document. This can be accessed via blackboard
          - Try to go through as many challenges as you can.
          - Some challenges has their answer right after them, so try not to look at the answer first and then compare your solution to mine.
          - There are some recommended videos and links at the end of this presentation. Try to watch/read/listen to them.
