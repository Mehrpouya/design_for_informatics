        ## If I miss or can't come to my own lab, can I join another one?
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ## Short answer no
        There are currently 82 of you. The lab has limited number of PCs and if we don't stick with what the registry has designed and organised for us, we'll end up with chaos.
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ## Long answer yes
        I'm happy to accommodate your needs and try to make this work for you. I appreciate you may have a **valid** reason to change your lab session, in this case you need to find someone from another DES105 lab to switch their place with you.

        If you slept in, or missed the bus or trying to finish a game level before coming to the class, then you can come to the next lab, but we can't guarantee to be able to fit you in again due to class numbers.

        <section data-markdown>
          - Make your first script in Unity
          - Learn basics of C#
            - Understand data types in C#
            - Variable operators and assignments
          - Learn version control and use github
            - Make a repository
            - make a few commits, push, pull and revert
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          This week you have 2 files to work your way through them.

          - Basics of C# programming, Practical II, III, IV - Part 1
          - Version Control, Practical II,III,IV - Part 1

          They are designed to be learned together however you can go through them individually too. If you are a bit familiar with C# then try to work on both, if not stick to Basics of C# programming for today.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## Why practical name says II,III,IV?
          - The practical material for the next three sessions which are this week and next couple of weeks are very related and you are welcome to go through them at your own pace as long as you make sure you finish them by end of week 4.
          - I am aiming to an alpha version of next week practical mid next week and finalise it before the lecture.

          ### Summary of your lab activity:
          - Follow the practical document. This can be accessed via blackboard
          - Spend sometime with the interface:
            - Understand modular Unity interface and customise it.
            - Remove some views and windows and try to add them back to the interface again.
          - Learn and find out about some navigation shortcuts.
          - Add, edit, group and remove some game objects and components to familiarise yourselves with them. Don't worry if you don't understand many of these yet.
