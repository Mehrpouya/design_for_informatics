          - What methods Jana used to investigate their topic?

        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#000">
          ### These are some of the methods Jana used in her research:
          - Focus group
          - In app data analytics
          - Field observations
          - Media recorder by participants
          - tasks you designed and how you engaged with them

          ##Pitch presentations
          Today in your practical you will pitch your game concepts. Once we're finished you can carry on working on your board games. Remember this is not just about pitching, It is also about learning how to think like a designer. Try to help others by analysing and questioning their design.

          "Someone who plays video games for 10 hours a day, for example, would be considered an idle person, and someone who frequently buys diapers would be considered as probably a parent, who on balance is more likely to have a sense of responsibility," Li Yingyun, Sesame's technology director told Caixin, a Chinese magazine, in February.

        <section  data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          A lengthy planning document from China's elite State Council explains that social credit will "forge a public opinion environment that trust-keeping is glorious", warning that the "new system will reward those who report acts of breach of trust".

          ###Video games are one of the most powerfull forms of media
        </section>
        <section  data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          One of the great characteristics of video games is the ability to immerse and live an experience based on your decisions. The stronger the narrative design of the game, the stronger effects it may have on players.

          Currently there are two industries running side by side. Game industry as we know it, with primary purpose of entertainment, and Education, which aims to purely educate audiences. However real learning often happens somewhere in between the two. Like anything else in life, learning and entertainment is also a spectrum. Try to think where your concept and game sits within this spectrum.

          Choice -- Limitations -- Calculations -- Incomparables

          In Bioshock you have to decide throughout the game, what weapons or perks are more useful for the challenges of that part of game. On the other hand If you have unlimited inventory, this may also confuse the player about what to choose for each challenge.

          ##Think like a designer
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          So far you have learned various ways to critique and anlyse games, in this section we will discuss a few more techniques and things to look out for to help you to critique and analyse each others work.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          ###Think like a designer n.1
            - Think about default scenarios that they designed?
            - What are the important mechanics?
            - What technical glitches the game has and how designers tried to resolve them! In a boardgame these can be seen as gaps in mechanics, narrative or the relationship between the two. cross player interaction,...
            - What were their point of views?
            - What is the relationship between rules and the play they create?
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          ###Think like a designer n.2
          - Try to think why the designer had to put each of those rules in their game?
          - How does each piece integrates into the whole story and game narrative?
          - How would the game change if you remove any of the rules?
          - Change some of the rules, play again and find out how they affect the game experience?
          - Identify, define and analyse metrics. These are the type of information that you collect from the user, how the designer is using them and how they are being presented in the game.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          ##Playtest
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          ###When you play-test your game or another game:
          - try to see if the game is playable without any help from the designer.
          - They should be self-explanatory.
          - Remember you won’t be there to help people playing your board game!
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          ###When you’re play testing:
          - Try to only offer the player the rule book of your game
          - Write down questions they ask and how they are playing your game?
          - Whether what they are playing is anything like what you have designed?
          - Try to give them as little information as possible as you are biased.
          - Think about why they are asking certain questions
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          There is always something to learn from testing your game, you need to find the right questions to ask!
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          The sooner you start play testing, the easier it will be to make changes. Bear in mind not to make too many dramatical changes which can result in you loosing your path and direction.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          ###You can’t just test your game yourself try step 1:
          - **friends and family:** this is still biased as they may try to avoid giving you any critical feedback ro question your dicisions, specially if you may get upset or annoyed by their feedback.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          ###You can’t just test your game yourself try step 2:
          - **Hardcore Gamers:** this again will give you a specific type of feedback. They are already familiar with many different game mechanics and has a a lot of experience of playing various video games. Their preferred genre of games may also affect their feedback as they are more specialised users.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown data-background="#0f2e28">
          ###You can’t just test your game yourself try step 3:
          - **casual players** they are the ones that may help you to improve some obvious flaws in your game design. Some of you experienced this when you were reading the game manuals of the board games you’ve played.
