          ##Marking
          - No need for a physics or lighting specific lecture, I will show you the basics again today.
          - The animation in your brief is just an example, basically anything you have made. Make sure to show them in first part of video and explain in second part.
          - Getting help wouldn't reduce your mark. Referencing people is a sign of appreciation and honesty. You do the same when you write essays, you say I used this person's paper for example.
          - Weights of each categories in rubric is not the same. Blueprints, AI, custom materials (material editor) and cinematics have higher weight.
          - I had a very productive conversaiton with Thomas, please ask him for updates and thank you for all of your comments.

          ##Lab practice 2: [Behaviour tree](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/AI/BehaviorTrees/QuickStart/5/index.html)
            - Create a new Third person/Top down project.
            - make new new folder for AI inside blueprints folder
            - inside the folder make the following:
              - AI Controller
              - AI character blueprint
              - AI blackboard
              - AI behaviour tree

          #Weekly assignment
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
        Make a 3rd person or top down level with several enemies. Each should have different AI behaviours.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ###Assignment details
          - Make a quick level with some obstacles (boxes, stairs,...)
          - create at least three enemies with distinctive AIs
            - The spy: As soon as they find you, they follow you at a distance.
            - The observer: One that stands as soon as they see you, they print something on the screen
            - The shooter: One that shoots and damages the player health
            - The Patrol: walks in a loop between pathnodes
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ###Further details
          - Try to get your AIs to share information about the player and their state
          - Try to add timers to your AI, so for instance they follow for 20 seconds and then they give up.
          - Get the patrol AI to climb stairs and then jump down to go to the beginning
          - How about other perceptions in your AI?

          ##Remember
            - you need to be able to show your work to me in the next lab (14th of October 2016).
            - Make lots of backups to ensure you won't loose your work.
            - Ensure & rensure your project runs on the lab machines.
            - Use comments to make your code clean and readable.
            - Submit more images inside your blog, from inside each blueprint that you want to show me.
            - You still need to submit a blog with several images, so I can mark your work.
