          ##Lab practice 1
            1. Animate a door using matinee
            2. Add a trigger box to your door to make it interactable
            3. Animate a fly through camera through the level
            4. Use a blueprint to play the Matinee at event play
            5. Add multiple cameras to your matinee and use a director group to fade in and out and control which camera is being viewed

        <section data-markdown>
          ##Lab practice 3
            - Add some customised particle systems to your level
            - Add some fog effects to some areas in your level. Try to customise and use both atmospheric and exponential fogs

          #Weekly assignment
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Make a multi store warehouse in 3rd person.
          Add several CCTV cameras. Each should have different FOV and movements. Animate a character walking in front of one of the cameras
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ###Assignment details
          - Start the level with showing the level from the CCTVs perspective
            - Switch between the cameras, fade in&out
            - After showing the level from the CCTVs, use a flythrough camera to move through your level and take us to the player character
          - Create at least two CCTV cameras with distinctive animations
          - Add customised particle systems to your level
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ###Further details
          - Spawn characters animate them through your level
          - Add a control unit to your level that allows the player to switch and look through the CCTV cameras, for example when near the control panel and pressing key "E" on keyboard switch to camera 1 and "R" to camera 2
            - You don't need a 3d model for controll unit, this can be simply a box with a blue texture on one side of it.
          - Add a lift to your level
            - Make the lift work with a trigger box
            - Try to make the lift work with a button

          ##Remember
          - you need to be able to show your work to me in the next lab (28th of October 2016).
          - Make lots of backups to ensure you won't loose your work.
          - Ensure & rensure your project runs on the lab machines.
          - Submit more images inside your blog, from inside each matinee/sequencer that you want to show me.
          - You still need to submit a blog with several images, so I can mark your work.
