          - Focus on an actor (3 ways)
          - Visual UI, Use "W" || "E" || "R" to change between Location, Rotation and Scale
          - Details tab
          - Scale uniformly and individually based on each axis
          - Change location based on different planes (XY axis, XZ axis, ...) and individually.
