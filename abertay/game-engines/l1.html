          ##What will we learn together?
          - Overview of some of the existing game engines
          - Game engine terminology and concepts
          - In depth look at Unreal Engine 4
          - Be able to apply this knowledge to practical applications (utilising game engines)
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## How will we learn?
          - 1 Lectorial (lecture + tutorial) per week: 2 hours session, about half an hour lecture and then practice together.
          - Practice and personal study, I recommend at least 7 hours weekly.
          - 2 hours open office time. Normally Wednesdays 10AM-12PM.
          - Our aim is to cover everything in the first 6 weeks, so you can spend a good chunk of time making, thinking and being creative.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## Usual structure of a lectorial session
          - 3 presentations by you, each about 5 minutes.
          - 15 - 20 minutes presentation by me
          - we spend rest of our time on practicing & learning in the lab.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## Your 5 minutes presentation
          - You only have to do it once, but you have to! unless you have a good reason not to.
          - You will investigate a game
            -  What engine they used? Physics? Interesting stuff about their game?
            - Show us some game play
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          - Make a 5 minutes presentation (video, pdf, power point, paper based)
          - Email it to me by Wednesday (if you are presenting on 16th of September, email presentation by Wednesday the 14th before 12pm)
          - Details of what you need to investigate is on weekly excersice description.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Some math
          - **Lecture**	: 3 hours - > 3 hours / 6 weeks = 30 minutes per week.
          - **Tutorial/Seminar**	: 9 hours - > 9 hours / 6 weeks = 1.5 hour per week
          - **Supervised Practical Activity**	: 12 hours - > 12 hours / 6 weeks = 2 hours per week. This will be from week 7-12
          - **Unsupervised Practical Activity**	: 12 hours, same equation.
          - **Assessment**	: 80 - > From end of week 6 (17th of October). This means 10 hours per week. Or 80 hours in week 12!
          - **Independent**	: 84 - > In twelve weeks, this means 7 hours per week. or 1.5 hours per day.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ##Advise
          - Try to go through what we discussed in each lectorial on the same day.
          - Aim to also watch the external recommended videos. (This will be at the end of each lectorial presentation)

          - Details tab
          - Scale uniformly and individually based on each axis
          - Change location based on different planes (XY axis, XZ axis, ...) and individually.
